**C Playground***
This repository is my personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with C programming!

**Here you'll find:**

Exercises and practice problems: I'll be pushing my solutions to various coding challenges and drills to solidify my understanding of C concepts.
Coding projects: As I progress, I'll build small projects to apply my newly acquired skills and explore different functionalities.
Notes and resources: This repo might also contain snippets of code, helpful resources, and personal documentation that I find useful during my C journey.


**Please note:**

This is primarily a learning resource for myself, so the code might not always be the most polished or efficient.
Feel free to browse around and learn from my mistakes (or, hopefully, successes!). I'm always open to feedback and suggestions.
If you find anything particularly interesting or helpful, feel free to fork and play around with it yourself!
Let's embark on this C adventure together!
